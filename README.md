Create performant HTML elements.

## Features
- works with [virtually every framework][adapt]
- speeds up perceived performance
- improves rendering performance
- graciously falls back if APIs are not available
- weighs `~4kb`

## Usage
### Defer rendering until the browser has spare time available
```js
var politeElement = component({
  placeholder: function () {
    return html`
      <p>lol not loaded yet</p>
    `
  },
  render: function () {
    return html`
      <p>HOW'S IT GOING CHAP</p>
    `
  }
})

console.log(politeElement())
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(politeElement())
}, 1000)
```

### Trigger lifecycle events when loading and unloading elements to the DOM
```js
var widgetElement = component({
  onload: function (el) {
    el.textContent = 'totally loaded now'
  },
  onunload: function (el) {
    el.textContent = 'no more free lunch'
  },
  onupdate: function (el, verb) {
    el.textContent = `totally ${verb}ing now`
  },
  render: function (verb) {
    return html`
      <p>lol not ${verb}ed yet</p>
    `
  }
})
console.log(widgetElement('load'))
var el = widgetElement('blep')
document.body.appendChild(el)
document.body.removeChild(el)
```

### Trigger lifecycle events when coming in and out of view
```js
var viewportElement = component({
  onenter: function (el) {
    el.textContent = 'BEHOLD THE GOBLIN'
  },
  onexit: function (el) {
    el.textContent = 'THE PONIES HAVE COME'
  },
  render: function () {
    return html`
      <h1>WHO COULD IT BE</h1>
    `
  }
})
console.log(viewportElement())
```

### Trigger lifecycle events when resizing
```js
var resizeElement = component({
  onresize: function (el) {
    var parent = el.parentNode
    console.log('element dimensions', el.getBoundingRectangle())
    console.log('parent dimensions', parent.getBoundingRectangle())
  },
  render: function () {
    return html`
      <div>hello planet</div>
    `
  }
})
console.log(resizeElement())
```

### Rendering inside frameworks
Check out [nanocomponent-adapters][adapt] on how to use `nanocomponent` in
your fav framework.

## API
### render = nanocomponent(HtmlOrFunctionOrObject)
Create an object with different methods attached. Cached until new arguments
are passed in or when it's removed from the DOM. Availble methods are:
- __render(...args):__ (required) Render DOM elements.
- __placeholder(..args)__ Render DOM elements and delegate the `render` call to
  the next `requestIdleCallback` tick. This is useful to spread CPU intensive
  work over more time and not block the render loop. When executed on the
  server `placeholder` will always be rendered in favor of `render`. This makes
  it easier for client-side JS to pick up where the server left off
  (rehydration).
- __onupdate(el, ...args):__ Allows you to change the internal DOM state when
  new arguments are passed in. It's called when the returned `render()` call is
  called after an initial render with different arguments. Argument equality is
  shallowly checked using a `===` check on each argument. The first argument is
  the currently rendered argument.
- __onenter:__ called when the element comes into view, relies on
  `window.IntersectionObserver`
- __onexit:__ Called when the element goes out of view, relies on
  `window.IntersectionObserver`
- __onload(el):__ Called when the element is appended onto the DOM
- __onunload(el):__ Called when the element is removed from the DOM
- __onresize:__ Called when the element changes size. :warning: This method can
  be called in high frequency and can cause strain on your CPU. Caution and/or
  debounce methods are advised.

### el = render(...args)
Call the corresponding `render` function an receive DOM elements. As long as an
element exists on the DOM, subsequent calls to `render` will return an empty
element with a `.isSameNode()` method on it which can be used as a caching hint
for HTML diffing trees.

## FAQ
### Why'd you build this package?
I've been building web stuff for a while now, and have seen a fair share of
frameworks become popular, take over developer mindshare and then disappear
again a few years later. With each framework iteration the basic libraries tend
to be rewritten from scratch: form validation, modals, infinite scolls, charts.
The list is long.

I think it'd be cool if we could create generic JS components that work
natively with any JS framework through slim bindings. This would encourage
reusability between frameworks, which means it becomes easier to pick up
different frameworks (no need to relearn the ecosystem) and bring new
frameworks to maturity (less new code to implement).

### This sounds a lot like WebComponents, how is this different?
WebComponents are a specification by the W3C that's been in the works for a
while now. Certain parts have been put on hold by browser vendors until kinks
are ironed out, and the some of the available parts are not widely adopted - or
at least not the way they were meant to be used.

When people talk about WebComponents they usually refer to the Custom Elements
specification. This spec allows you to create new HTML tags and provides you
with a set of lifecycle events. The `onload` / `onunload` / `render` /
`onupdate` events are indeed quite similar to Nanocomponent. The biggest
difference however, is the way in which elements are registered. Custom
Elements are globally scoped in the browser and must have unique names.
Nanocomponent is a plain JS function and will not run into namespacing issues.
It's quite feasible to wrap a Nanocomponent instance to create a Webcomponent.
The other way around is harder. Nanocomponent also exposes more events.

### I read somewhere that Nanocomponent uses some of the same techniques as React Fiber / React Stack. Could you talk some more about this?
Sure! React Fiber (or React Stack, I'm not sure what name they're ending up
with) is using the same APIs under the hood as Nanocomponent, but approaches it
from the other side of the spectrum.

Nanocomponent is intended to create individual components that can run in any
framework and have tight control over their performance. React Fiber is
a framework where the whole render tree is optimized on each loop.
Nanocomponent operates on the component layer, React Fiber at the framework
layer.

This doesn't mean that either one is "better" - every abstraction carries
overhead, and different situations require different solutions. I think it's
great performance is being tackled from multiple sides of the spectrum.

### What do you mean by "Nanocomponent works with any framework"?
Nanocomponent returns DOM elements that work in any framework that knows how to
render raw DOM nodes. This includes pretty much every popular framework and
compile-to-js language. Because the lifecycle events are self-encapsulated and
we don't expose globals this means Nanocomponent doesn't have any problems
running inside any other framework. I think Nanocomponent is quite similar in
browser framework land to how C / CPP packages operate

### I don't believe in silver bullets, tell me about the tradeoffs
All abstractions in JS come with a cost. Luckily the cost of Nanomorph is
fairly low (4kb, CPU and memory seem to be cool - haven't noticed any
significant repaint costs or anything), but it should not be neglected. Measure
and inform yourself.

Nanomorph relies on fairly new DOM APIs to do what it does. If you're running
v. old browsers this package won't help you - we're sorry.  As long as
`window.MutationObserver` is available we should be good; the others are
optimizations on top. These are the fancy APIs we're using:
- `window.MutationObserver`
- `window.IntersectionObserver`
- `window.requestAnimationFrame`
- `window.requestIdleCallback`

Third of all this package is optimized for an environment that supports
`require()`. I believe in iterating on proven ideas, and given the stability of
`require()` and the tooling & community around it I'm betting that it'll stick
around for a while.

Some frameworks (like React Fiber / React Stack) might have some cool
optimizations that allow super fine grained control over each and every element
in the tree - nanocomponent is similar but has its own rules to wait for
resources, so it might turn into an interesting situation where everyone is
super politely waiting for resources and like is nice to each other. I don't
know, but I'm guessing it'll be fun hah.

Also these components won't work in environments that don't have a DOM, but I
bet it'd be cool to look at those environments and figure out which primitives
they have and create equivalent functionality through generic components.

### Uahahghhhhblll
Yes!

### Does this render on the server?
Yup, it does. If it doesn't for your particular setup we'd like to hear.

## Installation
```sh
$ npm install nanocomponent
